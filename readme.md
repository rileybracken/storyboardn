# Week 1: Storyboardn
This little Storyboarding in iOS series so we can all learn how to Storyboard our own iOS apps.
The series is meant to be super short (30 minutes) once a week. Every week we will end with a
challenge. To get the most out of this it would be most benificial if you take the basics learned
during the series and play around with it on your own time during the week.

The structure will look something like this:
  - 10 minutes: show what you did with your previous weeks challenge
  - 15 minutes: go through a little teaching & questions
  - 5  minutes: go through the next challenge






### The next 4 weeks objectives (roughly):
Week 1:
  - Xcode UI
  - View Controllers
  - Basic storyboarding with the Object Library
  - Tab Bar Controllers
  - Asset management
  - Attributes inspector
  - Size inspector

Week 2:
  - Auto Layout
  - Size inspector (more in depth)

Week 3:
  - MVC pattern
  - Hooking our views up to code

Week 4:
  - More advanced hooking our views up to code
  - Start building a weather app






### Setup:
  - Make sure you are on Github & Xcode
  - Login to Xcode by going to Xcode -> Preferences (cmd + ,) and clicking on accounts

Creating Single View Applications will make it so our story board isn't bloated with stuff we
may not need.

Product name: whatever you want it to be
Organization Name & Organization Identifier: if you are signed in this will be auto populated
Notice we are building this for an iPhone only.

Right now we are only going to be doing a portrait app, this is because of AutoLayout issues,
which we will be covering next week.

# Week 1 Challenge
Build a UI of your own. I would recommend something that would test what we have talked about today,
add some images, add some text and a tabbar. Possibly a UI you have designed recently?
