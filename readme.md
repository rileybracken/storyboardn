# Week 1: Storyboardn
This little Storyboarding in iOS series so we can all learn how to Storyboard our own iOS apps.
The series is meant to be super short (30 minutes) once a week. Every week we will end with a
challenge. To get the most out of this it would be most benificial if you take the basics learned
during the series and play around with it on your own time during the week.

The structure will look something like this:
  - 10 minutes: show what you did with your previous weeks challenge
  - 15 minutes: go through a little teaching & questions
  - 5  minutes: go through the next challenge
